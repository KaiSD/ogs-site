* `index.html` redirects to `en/news/index.html`
* `images/` contains images for both news and pages

We maintain links to news published through Twitter, Facebook, Vkontakte during the time we used Pelican:

* 2017-summary
* example-driven-development
* examples-and-dependencies
* ideal-gamedev
* mahjong-demo2
* mahjong-recreation-start
* mahjong-techdemo1-gameplay
* openscenegraph-examples
* teaching-kids-to-program

Complete Pelican site is kept in `obsolete-pelican/` directory for historical reasons.

We also keep `mjin-player.js` because it was probably referenced somewhere outside Twitter, Facebook, Vkontakte.

`pages/` directory contains pages that were valid while we used Pelican. I have shared link to Mahjong 1 at least with Dieter by e-mail.

`news/` directory contains symlinks to Wordpress news as back as to 2016.

`lang/en/news` duplicates `news/` since those links were given by Wordpress as well.

`lang/ru/news` directory contains symlinks to Wordpress RU news as back as to 2016.
