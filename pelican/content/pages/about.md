#### Goals

The goals of Opensource Game Studio are:

* creation of free video game development tools
* creation of video games with those tools
* creation of video game development tutorials

We use opensource and freeware software as the base, that's why our tools are

To this date, we have released OGS Mahjong 1. It's a solitaire game and the
first step in the long path towards full-scale RPG we dream of.
